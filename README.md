## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project follows a clean, modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Folder Structure

```
/app
  /[tool-name]          # Tool-specific pages
    page.tsx            # Only layout and component usage
  layout.tsx            # Root layout with sidebar
  page.tsx              # Home dashboard

/components
  /ui                   # Shared UI components
    Sidebar.tsx         # Persistent sidebar
  /tools                # Tool-specific components
    CalculatorWidget.tsx

/hooks                  # Custom React hooks
  useCalculator.ts

/lib                    # Utility functions
  calculatorUtils.ts

/services               # API and backend interaction
  api.ts

/styles                 # Global styles
  globals.css
```

### Architecture Principles

1. **Functional Separation**
   - No business logic in page files
   - All logic separated into hooks, utilities, and services
   - Pages only contain layout and component usage

2. **Component Organization**
   - Shared components in `/components/ui/`
   - Tool-specific components in `/components/tools/`
   - Clear naming conventions

3. **State Management**
   - Custom hooks for complex state logic
   - Lightweight and focused state management
   - No global state unless necessary

4. **Performance**
   - Hardware-accelerated animations
   - Optimized re-renders with useCallback
   - Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## üöÄ Getting Started

## üé® Styling

This project uses:
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Custom CSS** for global styles and animations
- **Hardware acceleration** for smooth transitions
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach

## üì± Responsive Design

The sidebar and all tools are fully responsive:
- **Desktop**: Persistent sidebar with full navigation
- **Mobile**: Collapsible sidebar with overlay
- **Tablet**: Adaptive layout with optimized spacing

## üîß Development

### Adding New Tools

1. Create a new folder in `/app/[tool-name]/`
2. Add a `page.tsx` file with only layout and components
3. Create tool-specific components in `/components/tools/`
4. Add business logic to custom hooks in `/hooks/`
5. Add utility functions to `/lib/` if needed
6. Update the sidebar navigation in `/components/ui/Sidebar.tsx`

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices
- Use custom hooks for complex logic
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful variable and function names
