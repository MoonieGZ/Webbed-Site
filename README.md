A collection of useful tools for various uses, also includes a PFQ playground. Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## üöÄ Features

- **Persistent Sidebar Navigation** - Easy access to all tools
- **Responsive Design** - Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile
- **Dark Mode Support** - Beautiful dark and light themes
- **Smooth Animations** - Hardware-accelerated transitions
- **Modular Architecture** - Clean separation of concerns

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project follows a clean, modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Folder Structure

```
/app
  /[tool-name]          # Tool-specific pages
    page.tsx            # Only layout and component usage
  layout.tsx            # Root layout with sidebar
  page.tsx              # Home dashboard

/components
  /ui                   # Shared UI components
  /tools                # Tool-specific components

/hooks                  # Custom React hooks

/lib                    # Utility functions

/services               # API and backend interaction

/styles                 # Global styles
  globals.css
```

### Architecture Principles

1. **Functional Separation**
   - No business logic in page files
   - All logic separated into hooks, utilities, and services
   - Pages only contain layout and component usage

2. **Component Organization**
   - Shared components in `/components/ui/`
   - Tool-specific components in `/components/tools/`
   - Clear naming conventions

3. **State Management**
   - Custom hooks for complex state logic
   - Lightweight and focused state management
   - No global state unless necessary

4. **Performance**
   - Hardware-accelerated animations
   - Optimized re-renders with useCallback
   - Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (recommended) or npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Website
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```

## üé® Styling

This project uses:

- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Custom CSS** for global styles and animations
- **Hardware acceleration** for smooth transitions
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach

## üì± Responsive Design

The sidebar and all tools are fully responsive:

- **Desktop**: Persistent sidebar with full navigation
- **Mobile**: Collapsible sidebar with overlay
- **Tablet**: Adaptive layout with optimized spacing

## üîß Development

### Adding New Tools

1. Create a new folder in `/app/[tool-name]/`
2. Add a `page.tsx` file with only layout and components
3. Create tool-specific components in `/components/tools/`
4. Add business logic to custom hooks in `/hooks/`
5. Add utility functions to `/lib/` if needed
6. Update the sidebar navigation in `/components/ui/Sidebar.tsx`

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices
- Use custom hooks for complex logic
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful variable and function names
